# pe-api-hacks

Some scripts to make calls to the Node Classifier Service API of
Puppet Enterprise. They are intended to be ran on the puppet master.

Beware there is no error checking or safety in these scripts, they should
be used with caution.

Please read the Node Classifier Service API section at the [Puppet Docs](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/latest/nc_forming_requests.html)
website and the comments/help (such that there is) in each script before
using them !

These work for me while provisioning puppet in AWS but have had limited
testing for my use cases only. YMMV.

Standard "I didn't break it" disclaimers apply ;-)
